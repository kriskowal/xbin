A collection of nonstandard Unix hacks
for command line awesomeness.


xip
---

The name "zip" was already taken.  This
interlaces the contents of a variadic list
of files, especially handy with subshell
file descriptor replacement.  The following
shows the opposing sides of a six sided die.
The first example works in BSD variants, and
the second in SysV/Linux variants::

    xip <(jot 6) <(jot 6 6 1) | xargs -n 2
    xip <(seq 6) <(seq 6 -1 1) | xargs -n 2


dog
---

Buffers stdin into memory until it closes,
then writes to a given file.  This is handy
for pipeline loops, where normally redirecting
to and from the same file would result in
premature truncation.  The following are
equivalent::

    sort file
    cat file | sort | dog file
